created collection page added filter by category andsort by price functionality and also a search product functionaliuty

the product data is fetched on page load by the context which is then used as the flterproducts which is mapped and rendered.based on the category selected and selected sub category the filterproducvts array changes which changes the the items rendered.this filtered products array is then modified according the tmethod choosed form prceing which is from low to high or high to low


for the the search functionality we create state variable in the context called search and the setter function setSearch
also another state variable with booklean variable showSearch and setShowSerch
     
then we add that to the functions that is available through the context

then we create a copmponent called search bar which will be integerated in the collections page when the search is toggled

the searchbar component is displayed on if showSearch value is true

next we want to set up the search bar such that it is displayed only in the collection page

for that we use cosnt location = useLocation which will find out which route is currently rendered 
then well set up a useeffect to track the the current location and toggle a state variable called visible .Based on the truthy value of visible only the search bar component will get rendered

then we use the search and shoSearch from the context in the collections

in the apply filter function which filters the products vased on codition we addd a if statement that checks if the shoSearch is true and if true it will check if any of the items contains the the search term

if(showSearch && search){
filterdProductscopy =filterdProductscopy.filter(item=> item.name.toLowerCase().includes(search.toLowerCase()) }

and then we add search nad ShowSearch to the dependencies of teh useeffect that calls the apply filterfunction so that when ver the search term changes product filtering happens accordingly
