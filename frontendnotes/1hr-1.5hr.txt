created context file:
import { useContext } from "react";
import { products } from "../assets/frontend_assets/assets";
const ShopContext = useContext;
const ShopContextProvider = (props) => {
const delivery_fee = 10;
const currency = "$";
    const value = {
products
    }
    return (
        <ShopContext.Provider value={value} delivery_fee={delivery_fee} currency={currency}>
            {props.children}
        </ShopContext.Provider>
    )
}
export default ShopContextProvider
Onece e create th context file we add that context I the main file so that its accessible in all the componets that consiumes the context
_________________________________________________________________
then we create a component called latest collection and in it we create a ;lates collection component

we then mount that n in the homepage under the hero section

in the latest collection page we getthe products from the useContext and then slice them for 10 items and assign to a state variable which weel map out to display the using a component called product  item to which we will pass the props of each itrem
_____________
then we create a product item component to list out the individual products
----------------------
then we create a component called best seller.jsx
to display the best seller products
take the similar approach as latest collection 
from the products imported from context filter out the once whose bestseller property is try and render using the product item component
